# You're A Manager? Yes, You Might Be Evil.

I believe empathy permits us to love.  Understanding the plight of another enables us to share their feelings and develop interpersonal connections.  Lack of empathy, that is apathy, is therefore the enabler of ignorance, selfishness and even hatred.  Empathy is to love as selfishness is to evil.

Selfishness and ignorance, these qualities of apathy, are required of people who exert their will upon others.  These qualities are easiest to identify in rapists, murderers, slave masters, abusive parents, and bullies.  These qualities are more difficult to acknowledge, but no less true, in managers.  The propensity to exert our will upon others is true of all humans and manifest to varying degrees in all social systems including friendships, families, communities, and governments.  To the extent we have developed our emotional intelligence, calmed our egoist inclination and achieved self-actualization, we can subdue our base desire to exert our will upon others.  This aspect of human nature is tolerated to varying degrees in conventional human systems; for example, nobody second-guesses a parent who puts brocolli on a child's plate; and everybody expects their local police service to enforce law; but moral lines are drawn to stamp out undesirable, though naturally occuring, behaviours.

Where does management fall on such a spectrum?  Well, let's be clear, management is the practice of exerting one's will upon others.  Either:

- explicitly
  - through the defining of procedures and delegation of work,
- or implicitly
  - through all other acts (intentional or conventional) of subordination.

I know some readers will claim I have cherry-picked these facts or that I am too focused on the word's etymology and have not allowed for modern interpretations. (See Also: [Etymology of Management](#EtymologyOfManagement).)
