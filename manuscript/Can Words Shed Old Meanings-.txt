# Can Words Shed Old Meanings? {#NewMeanings}

All words have a lineage.  Linguists study the evolution of words much the same way anthropologists study the evolution of humans.  Authors throughout history, and the ways they wrote words into sentences and poetry, indicate the history of our words and their derivatives.

## Yes

### Examples

- Geek (as in 'fool' or 'carnival performer')
- Town (used to mean 'fence')
- Gay (used to imply joyfulness, never used that way anymore)
- Faggot (as in 'bundle of sticks')
- Nerd (first meant as 'stupid or crazy person', is now always applied to the 'smart' and socially awkward)

## 'Management' Has Not Shed Its Old Meanings

### The reason for 'management':
- Animal husbandry

### Ancestors of 'management':

- mano (Spanish meaning hand)
- mänō ä ˈmänō means hand to hand. (not man to man, as many English speakers will easily conclude)
- hand > handle > handling (of tools specifically)
- menaggerie (an animal shelter, barn, stables)

### Descendants of 'management':
- manage the animals > manage the farm > manage the business of the farm > manage business > manage finance
