# Interview Questions:

Is there a software tool that one can use to display the 'family tree', so to speak, of words?

Can you tell me about a word that shouldn't exist?  (example: unthaw) (or a word which linguists puzzle & frown about)
- irregardless
- unthaw
- disorientated
---- is there a 'name' or category for these sorts of words?

I assert that words do not shed their old meanings -- that words can take on new meanings but they *never* shed their old meanings.  Do you agree with this assertion?  (if not, can you tell me of a word which has in fact shed an old meaning?) 
{//words that have 'changed'
- girl
- hound
- sly
- knight - meant servant
- town -- wall
}

Which words would you say are the ancestors of 'manage'?

What might you say are the CONS or PROS of deprecating the words 'manager' and 'management' (with regard to human-to-human relationships)?

Can you tell me about a word that humans have chosen _to use_ in order to initiate societal change?
- black (say more about this please)
- gay (happy among homosexual - where might I find more information?)

Can you tell me about a word that humans have chosen to stop using, in order to initiate societal change?
- nigger
- negro

Would you like that I include you as a "Contributor"?  Contributors don't get a share of royalties, but are credited on the book's public pages. This will include names of editors, reviewers, submitters of included essays, people I've interviewed.
