# There Is Always A Better Word

Popular argument: "But not all managers are evil.  Some are helpful, knowledgeable, and considerate."

Sure we can and do apply many senses to the word 'management'.  Some more friendly than others: in the sense that a manager may be a person who guides others; or one who manages processes or tools for people; or one who manages nicely and with a supportive (rather than superior) manner.  To deny that 'management' denotes those meanings would be ignorant.

.... go on with examples of better words.  Goal: the words 'management' and 'manage' and 'manager' cause us to be lazy (in our thinking) -- these words are ambiguous copouts and actually obscure, rather than clarify, the pool of meaning.
