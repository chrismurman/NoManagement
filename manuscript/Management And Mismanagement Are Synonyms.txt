# 'Management' And 'Mismanagement' Are Synonyms

Some words in our language are wierd.  The history and usage of some words is so convoluted that lexicographers and linguists are basically dumbstruck.

Examples:
- disorientated -- this word shouldn't exist.  It means the same as 'disoriented'.
- unthaw -- this word shouldn't be necessary.  It means the same as 'thaw'.

Sometimes we use words that are simply nonsense.  'Management' is one of those words.  Here's why...


If a = b & c
and if d = c & e
then both a & d = c
so, a = d

Curiosity led me to this page:

I laughed out loud.

The definition and synonyms of 'mismanagement' perfectly describe the behaviours and effects of most managers I have worked with.
