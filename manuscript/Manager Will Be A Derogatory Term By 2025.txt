# 'Manager' Will Be A Derogatory Term By 2025

Most people whose job title does not contain 'manager' have a healthy disdain for the whole idea.  I am decidedly of this group.  I would be happy to never hear the word again; I would be ecstatic if this little book helps society to stop using the word before my daughters grow up; I will be very disappointed in all of us if we suffer beyond another decade with this antiquated, unecessary, and dehumanizing business practice -- and so long as the word is in use, I'm afraid the practice will persist.

Of those whose job title does contain 'manager', there are three sub-groups within:

  1.  those who are desparately trying to climb the corporate ladders;
  2.  those who are reluctantly climbing the corporate ladders, doing so only because their employer provides no other path toward higher salary;
  3.  those who are actively trying to find new employment where *delivering* great work is valued more than *controlling* others' work.

To point #1 above, some people I have worked with relish their job title: *manager* of this department or that program, or of these people or those processes.  Scott Adams, author of [Dilbert Comics](http://dilbert.com "Dilbert Comics"), has made a career of poking fun at those people.  Gary Cole, famously known as [Bill Lumbergh](http://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=%22Gary%20Cole%22%20%22Office%20Space%22 "Bill Lumbergh Videos Online") of *Office Space*, personifies the flaccid role that management plays in modern business.  Let's be clear: we laugh at these characters not because they're fiction, but because they're too real.

To points #2 and #3 above, some people whose job title contains 'manager' carry themselves with admirable humility.  Such people are rare and I hope this book helps to liberate them from their constrictive title.

There is a shift happening in the language of the workplace and I believe 'manager' and 'management' will be soon be derogatory terms.
