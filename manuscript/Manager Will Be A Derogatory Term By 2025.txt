# 'Manager' Will Be A Derogatory Term By 2025

1. Most people whose job title does not contain 'manager' have a healthy disdain for the whole idea.  I am decidedly of this group.  There are three sub-groups within: those who are desparately trying to climb the corporate ladders; those who are reluctantly climbing the corporate ladders and doing so only because their employer provides no other path toward higher salary; those who are actively trying to find new employment where _delivering_ great work is valued more than _controlling_ others' work.

2. Some people whose job title contains 'manager' carry themselves with admirable humility.  These people are rare and I hope this book helps to liberate them from their constrictive title.

3. Some people I have worked with relish their job title: _manager_ of this department or that program, of these people or those processes.  Scott Adams, author of [Dilbert Comics](http://dilbert.com "Dilbert Comics"), has made a career of poking fun at those people.  Gary Cole, famously known as [Bill Lumbergh](http://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=%22Gary%20Cole%22%20%22Office%20Space%22 "Bill Lumbergh Videos Online") of _Office Space_, personifies the flaccid role that management plays in modern business.  Let's be clear: we laugh at these characters not because they're fiction, but because they're all too real.

There is a shift happening in the language of the workplace and I believe 'manager' and 'management' will be soon be derogatory terms.
