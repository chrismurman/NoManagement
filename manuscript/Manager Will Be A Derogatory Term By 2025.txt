# 'Manager' Will Be A Derogatory Term By 2025

There is a shift happening in the language of the workplace and I believe 'manager' and 'management' will be soon be derogatory terms.  Scott Adams, author of [Dilbert Comics](http://dilbert.com "Dilbert Comics"), has made a career of poking fun at management.  Gary Cole, famously known as [Bill Lumbergh](http://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=%22Gary%20Cole%22%20%22Office%20Space%22 "Bill Lumbergh Videos Online") of *Office Space*, personifies the flaccid role that management plays in modern business.  Let's be clear: we laugh at those characters not because they are fiction, but because they are too real.

Among people whose job title contains 'manager', there are three sub-groups:

1.  those who are desparately trying to climb the corporate ladders, and doing so by improving their management skills;
2.  those who are reluctantly climbing the corporate ladders, doing so only because their employer provides no other path toward higher salary;
3.  those who are actively trying to find new employment where *delivering* great work is valued more than *controlling* others' work.

To point #1 above, some managers I have worked with relish their job title: *manager* of this department or that program, *manager* of these people or those processes.  To points #2 and #3 above, some people whose job title contains 'manager' carry themselves with admirable humility.  Such people are rare and I hope this book helps to liberate them from their constrictive title.

Most people whose job title does *not* contain 'manager' have a healthy disdain for the whole thing.  I am decidedly of this group!  I would be happy to never hear the word again; I would be ecstatic if this little book helps society to stop using the word before my daughters grow up; I will be very disappointed in all of us if we suffer beyond another decade with this antiquated, unecessary, and dehumanizing business practice.  So long as the word is in use, I am afraid the practice will persist.
