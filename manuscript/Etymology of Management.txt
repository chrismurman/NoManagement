# Etymology of 'Management' {#EtymologyOfManagement}

![Etymology of Management](images/Etymology of Manager (Portrait).png "Etymology of Management")

Our muscles contract.  They do not protract.  That is, in order to bend our arm we must coordinate the contraction of some muscles while simultaneously relaxing others.  The tricep and bicep, for example, are primarily reponsible for moving the arm at the elbow.  In order for our bicep to bend our arm, our tricep must relax.  Likewise, to straighten our arm, the bicep must relax while the tricep pulls the forearm against the elbow joint.  In order to describe this essential physiology, ancient languages devised complementary words which mean "to seize" and "to let go" -- to contract and relax, to pull and release.

English speakers have inherited two such words from proto-Germanic languages:

- hinþaną:
  - a proto-Germanic verb which meant "to obtain" or "to seize";
- hantalōn:
  - a proto-Germanic verb which meant "to let go" or "to offer".

Those two words led to 'handuz' which meant 'hand'.  You see, our hand can seize and let go, close then open, contract then relax.

Together, those words describe the actions required to control our limbs and digits and, by extension, to manipulate tools.  To control our own body we must coordinate the pulling and letting-go of our muscles.  Further examination of those words reveals that 'hantalōn' is also the ancestor of 'handle' and 'handling' -- which directly describe the deliberate manipulation of tools (eg. handles).  To control tools, we must 'seize' or pull them with our hands then release them.  The proto-Germanic 'handuz', which is the ancestor of 'hand', has a parallel in ancient Latin: 'manus' which meant "belonging to the hand" (where 'belonging' implies ownership as in "power over").

We learned to control animals similar to the way we learned to weild axes and hammers -- first by having power over them then by controlling them as tools of agriculture or transportation.  'Manus' and its derivates were naturally applied to the practices related to domestication and taming of animals.  The reins, for example, are a tool that we hold in our hands and pull against the neck of a horse, and by pulling the rein we control the animal's direction.  The horse knows to obey the signal through repeated training.  This act of pulling the reins to control animals is called 'maneggiare' -- an Italian noun which literally meant 'wirepulling' and, when applied as a verb, meant 'to handle'.

And there is the link.  'Maneggiare' describes the handling of animals; 'menagerie' is a word which describes a collection of live animals and the enclosure in which they are kept; 'manège' translates from early French to English as 'horsemanship'.  Etymology therefore indicates the word 'management' originates from animal husbandry and the earliest uses of the terms 'manage', 'manager', and 'management' refer to the keeping of animals.  One might argue that managers are "to care for" the animals -- that management is about caring; but, no, that is what 'husbandry' means.  The words 'handle' and 'manage' have a shared past and both are clearly related to the use and control of animals as tools.

## Modern Application

While 'management' originally referred to the keeping of animals and their stables (the *menagerie*), eventually the word became generally applied to the keeping of the house.  By 14th century A.D. the French word 'ménage' meant household.  'Ménager' refers to housekeeping and cleaning; 'ménagère' translates to English as 'housewife'.  As well, the term 'management' became broadly used to describe the keeping of, not only the animals and household, but the farm, the property, and all of its related business operations: hired hands, finances, etc.  As industrial commerce grew through the 18th and 19th centuries, 'management' was then applied to operating a business and its company of employees.

Some may argue that the word has evolved and its ancient applications are no longer relevant.  I disagree.  I believe the history of words can teach us powerful lessons.  Today, the relationships we see in the world of business between managers and their subordinates is as complex and sensitive as the relationship we have with our domestic animals.  That is, we have a great respect for the animals (subordinates) that we keep.  Their strength is useful while performing difficult work.  We often describe them as companions or comrades.  And their energy can be consumed to ease and sustain our own lives.

## What About Other Languages

Etymology is an artful discipline which requires both historical awareness and cultural sensitivity.  Modern English words are not only translatable with other languages but also have ancient parallels.  Each language devised ways to describe our simple muscle movements -- seizing, then letting go.  Using the muscles of our hand, we can manipulate tools.  And the vernacular of tools then applied to animals ('animated' tools) used for their strength and speed in farming, battle, or transportation.  In some cultures, we see in the evolution of their language that those words (which describe the use of animals as tools) then applied to general administration of companies:

- such as management of horses of the cavalry and the soldiers which ride them;
- such as management of animals and the hired hands on a farm.

In other cultures, that jump from animals to people is not as direct as it was in French and English.  Yet, when we examine the possible translations of 'management' into other languages, it is clear they (non-English speakers) know what we (the English speakers) truly mean: control.
