# Etymology of 'Management' {#EtymologyOfManagement}

![Etymology of Management](images/Etymology of Manager (Portrait).png "Etymology of Management")

Etymology indicates the word 'management' has origins in animal husbandry.  Managers may argue that 'management' therefore meant _to care for_ the animals; but, no, that is what 'husbandry' means.  Management is not about caring.  It's about handling the animals, and handling an animal means using it like a tool (a handle, a tool in a man's hand).  As illustrated above, the words 'handle' and 'manage' have a shared past and both are related to the domestication and use of animals as tools.

## Modern Application

The relationships we see in the world of business between managers and their subordinates is as complex and sensitive as the relationship we have with our domestic animals.  That is, we have a great respect for the animals (subordinates) that we keep.  Their strength is useful while performing menial work.  We often describe them as companions or comrades.  And their energy can be consumed to ease and sustain our own lives.

## What About Other Languages

Etymology is an artful discipline which requires both historical awareness and cultural sensitivity.  Modern English words are not only translatable with other languages but also have ancient parallels.  Is English then the only language in which 'management' relates to the controlling of tools, animals, and people?  No, when we examine the possible translations of 'management' into other languages, the etymology of those other-language equivalents connotes the control and wilful manipulation of others.
