# Management Is About Control And Everybody Knows It {#ManagementIsAboutControl}

## Translations of 'Management'

As we examine how 'management' is translated by speakers of other languages, two things become clear:

1. first, the word has many meanings;
2. and second, its earliest meanings are clearly and undeniably about command or manipulation of others, and control or reign over others.

Of course, there are other words which also connote 'control' such as: direct, officiate, conduct, govern, and so on.  One can govern a community by negotiating policy and law; one can officiate a soccer game; one can direct a theatrical play; one can conduct a symphonic orchestra.  Those words are most appropriately used when discussing *systems* like law, game, performing art (as in the aforementioned examples).  However, when one is speaking about control of others -- specifically humans controlling other humans -- the word 'management' is not just applicable but is actually the *most* appropriate.  It is *the* word in our language which most concisely and effectively in a single utterance describes the practice of controlling other people.  And the whole words knows it.
