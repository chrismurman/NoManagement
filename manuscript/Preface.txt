# Preface

As this text is primarily an examination of the word 'management' as used in modern society, I consider all references to be valid no matter how reputable the source.  I make reference to books, tweets, song lyrics, fiction and non-fiction, and I regard all uses to be important.  I will cherry pick.  I will ignore other studies which do not support my conclusions.  I will include Bing's or Google's published definition of a word as evidence without corroboration.  I will quote Michael Scott of *The Office* and Frederick Winslow Taylor, perhaps even in the same sentence, and I do not mind that one is a fictional character.

This book is a study but is not based on disciplined academic research.  It is full of my opinion and I do not intend to *prove* anything.

I write this book for everyone who has been managed.
