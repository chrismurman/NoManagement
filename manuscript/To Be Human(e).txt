# To Be Human(e)

Maslow's Hierarchy of Human Needs aptly illustrates the precoonditions for self-actualization.  It is clear in his research and that of many others that...

A humane work environment, therefore, is one which enables, if not provide, all our needs; moroever, is one which does not limit _____. (autonomy perhaps?)

....goal of this chapter: the word management causes 'subordinate' behaviours and reinforces a caste system.  We can't achieve self-actualization so long as our language imposes constraints upon our autonomy.

(Hmm...one might argue that the Gamma people in Aldous Huxley's book were perfectly content and fully self-actualized by perpetuating their own enslavement -- they were designed to be muscle-bound, manual labourers so would Maslow agree their humanity should be limited to that work?  Theory X behaviours / Theory Y people)
